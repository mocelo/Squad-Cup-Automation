# Squad-Cup-Automation

Students in Kibo’s degree program are divided into peer groups (called squads) of 4-5 students. These peer groups allow students to have a smaller set of social connections among the larger degree cohort, allowing for the creation of deeper connections. Squads are both an academic and non-academic unit, e.g. they could be the groups that students use for group work in their courses and they could be the study groups that students form to support their studies, but they could also be one of the social groups that students have during the program to provide more holistic support.

One of the challenges with squads is that there isn’t a clear motivation for students to engage with each other, until they personally realize the value of having an academic and non-academic support system. This can take time, and might be hindered by the fact that a lot of the students in the founding class have other significant time commitments alongside their studies at Kibo.

The Squad Cup aims to solve this issue, and to create some motivation (a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation) during the 1st year of their studies for students to engage with their squad mates.
What is the Squad Cup? (The What)
The Squad Cup is a termly points based competition between all the degree program squads. 
What are the mechanics of the squad cup? (The How)
